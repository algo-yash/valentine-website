            <h3>My Dearest Damayanti ❤️</h3>
            <p>From the moment I met you, my heart knew it had found its home.</p>
            <p>Your smile makes my whole world brighter.</p>

            <p>First of all, I keep thinking about all our memories.</p>
            <p>The way we fight over the smallest things… and then five minutes
               later we miss each other.</p>
            <p>Our random calls, laughing at the dumbest jokes, getting annoyed for no reason, 
              and then making up like nothing ever happened.</p>
            <p>We’re not perfect.</p>
            <p>We argue. We both have egos sometimes.</p>
            <p> sometimes I’m immature.</p>
            <p>But after every fight, I realize one thing I don’t want a
               life where you’re not in it.</p>
            <p>And there’s something important I need to say.</p>
            <p>In our last fight, I was wrong.</p>
            <p>I tried to manipulate you. I was being toxic.</p>
            <p>That’s not the kind of person I want to be, 
              especially not with you.</p>
            <p>You deserve to feel safe, loved, and respected not pressured 
              or emotionally hurt.</p>
            <p>I’m truly sorry. No excuses.</p>
            <p>I’m not perfect, but I want to grow. I want to be better for you and for us.</p>
            <p>I love you so much, my pretty little baby ❤️</p>
            <p>You’re not just a habit in my life you’re my choice.</p>
            <p>And I choose you, every single day.</p>
            <p>Happy Valentine's Day, my love. Thank you for being mine.</p>
            <p class="signature">Forever yours,<br>Yash 💕</p>
